# Student Management
## Project Overview
This project provides the backend API for a full-stack Student Management application. It enables managing student records with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via a RESTful interface.
The frontend for this application is developed separately and is available in another GitHub repository: [Student-Management-Frontend](https://github.com/N0-Regrets/Student-Management-Frontend).
A live demo of the frontend application is also available [here](https://student-management-a868b.web.app/home).
